# Hospital Management System - Project Summary

## Overview
We've created a modern Hospital Management System using Java Spring Boot for the backend and React for the frontend. This system replaces the original PHP-based system with a more robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

## Key Improvements Over Original System

1. **Modern Tech Stack**:
   - Replaced PHP/MySQL with Java Spring Boot and React
   - Used Spring Security for robust authentication and authorization
   - Implemented JWT for secure token-based authentication
   - Used JPA/Hibernate for ORM instead of raw SQL queries
   - Implemented Material UI for a responsive, modern design

2. **Better Architecture**:
   - Clear separation between frontend and backend with RESTful API
   - Proper MVC architecture on the backend
   - Component-based architecture on the frontend
   - Repository pattern for data access
   - DTO pattern for data transfer

3. **Enhanced Security**:
   - Password hashing with BCrypt
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Protected API endpoints
   - Input validation with Bean Validation

4. **Improved User Experience**:
   - Responsive design that works on all devices
   - Single-page application for faster navigation
   - Modern UI with Material Design
   - Form validation for better user feedback
   - Intuitive user interface

5. **Additional Features**:
   - PDF generation for prescriptions
   - Role-based access control (patient, doctor, admin)
   - Better appointment management
   - Enhanced doctor search and filtering

## Implementation Details

### Backend
- **Java Spring Boot**: For building the RESTful API
- **Spring Security**: For authentication and authorization
- **Spring Data JPA**: For database access
- **H2 Database**: For development (can be replaced with MySQL/PostgreSQL for production)
- **JWT**: For token-based authentication
- **iText PDF**: For PDF generation

### Frontend
- **React**: UI library with functional components and hooks
- **Material UI**: Component library for responsive design
- **React Router**: For navigation
- **Formik & Yup**: For form validation
- **Axios**: For API requests
- **JWT Decode**: For token handling

## Database Schema

The system uses the following main entities:
- **User**: Base entity for all users (patients, doctors, admins)
- **Role**: User roles (PATIENT, DOCTOR, ADMIN)
- **Patient**: Patient-specific information
- **Doctor**: Doctor-specific information
- **Appointment**: Appointment details
- **Prescription**: Prescription details
- **Medication**: Medications in a prescription

## API Endpoints

The system provides the following main API endpoints:
- **Auth**: Login, register, get current user
- **Doctors**: CRUD operations for doctors, search by specialization
- **Appointments**: Book, cancel, complete appointments
- **Prescriptions**: Create, view, mark as paid, generate PDF

## Future Enhancements

1. **Telemedicine Integration**: Video consultations with doctors
2. **Online Payment**: Integration with payment gateways
3. **Medical Records**: Electronic health records management
4. **Notifications**: Email and SMS notifications for appointments
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: For hospital administrators
6. **Mobile App**: Native mobile applications for iOS and Android
